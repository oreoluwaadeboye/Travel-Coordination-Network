# Decentralized Time Travel Coordination Network (DTCN)

## Overview
The Decentralized Time Travel Coordination Network (DTCN) is a blockchain-based system designed to manage and coordinate temporal displacement activities while preserving causality and preventing paradoxes. The platform uses quantum-encrypted smart contracts to maintain timeline integrity across multiple realities.

## Core Components

### Temporal Integrity Contract
Maintains the coherence of the timeline and prevents causality violations.


Key features:
- Paradox detection algorithms
- Causality chain verification
- Timeline consistency checking
- Quantum state preservation
- Temporal shielding protocols
- Grandfather paradox prevention
- Bootstrap paradox detection

### Event Logging Contract
Records and validates all temporal modifications.

Key features:
- Immutable timeline recording
- Change verification systems
- Temporal GPS tracking
- Reality hash generation
- Modification impact assessment
- Historical accuracy verification
- Temporal forensics tools

### Alternate Reality Tracking Contract
Monitors and manages branching timelines.

Key features:
- Timeline divergence tracking
- Reality branch mapping
- Quantum probability calculation
- Timeline merger protocols
- Reality stabilization
- Divergence point monitoring
- Branch collapse prevention

### Temporal Ethics Compliance Contract
Enforces guidelines for responsible time travel.

Key features:
- Ethics violation detection
- Historical preservation rules
- Cultural protection protocols
- Temporal rights management
- Indigenous time protection
- Historical figure safeguards
- Artifact preservation rules

## Usage

### Timeline Modification Request
```solidity
function requestTimelineChange(
    uint256 targetTimestamp,
    bytes32 locationHash,
    ChangeParameters memory params,
    bytes32 ethicsCompliance
) external returns (bytes32 requestId)
```

### Reality Branch Creation
```solidity
function createRealityBranch(
    bytes32 divergencePoint,
    BranchParameters memory params,
    bytes32 stabilityProof
) external returns (bytes32 branchId)
```

### Temporal Ethics Verification
```solidity
function verifyEthicalCompliance(
    bytes32 proposedChange,
    uint256 impactRadius,
    bytes32 historicalContext
) external returns (bool)
```

## Governance

The network is governed by:
- Temporal Ethics Board
- Historical Preservation Council

## Disclaimer

Time travel operations carry inherent risks to causality and reality stability. All travelers must acknowledge and accept the possibility of timeline alterations, reality branches, and existence paradoxes. The DTCN cannot guarantee the preservation of the original timeline or the traveler's primary reality.
